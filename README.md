# CityPulse Wallet

Created by **Claire Xue** for the DSV-Gruppe Generative City-Wallet hackathon challenge.

CityPulse Wallet is an AI-powered city wallet that turns real-time city signals into personalized, wallet-ready local offers.

Built for the DSV-Gruppe **Generative City-Wallet** hackathon challenge, the project demonstrates how a city wallet can serve both residents and local merchants: users receive relevant offers at the right moment, while merchants set simple business goals and let AI generate safe, localized promotions.

## Demo Entry

Start from:

```txt
/welcome
```

From the welcome screen, you can enter:

- **Customer app**: discover nearby offers, save passes, redeem offers, and explore live city context.
- **Merchant mode**: set a business goal, adjust guardrails, review an AI-generated offer, and track lightweight results.

## Product Concept

CityPulse Wallet detects live city context such as:

- Weather changes
- Nearby activity and demand
- Location and distance
- Time-sensitive windows
- Local merchant goals

It then converts those signals into one best next action for the user: a relevant local offer that is ready to redeem through the wallet.

## Key Features

### Customer Mode

- Premium mobile wallet-style home screen
- AI-matched hero offer based on live city signals
- Discover page with real map experience
- Category filters for local offers
- Passes page for active, upcoming, and used passes
- Offer detail and redeem flows

### Merchant Mode

- Merchant dashboard for a simple business goal
- Goal setup with selectable chips, time window, discount, and radius controls
- AI offer review with reasoning and guardrail checks
- Merchant profile mode
- Separate merchant bottom navigation: Home, Goal, Offer, Profile

### Live Context and AI Simulation

The app combines live/demo context data with a simulated AI offer engine. It uses structured offer data, weather/context hooks, and local signal scoring to recommend offers in a believable way for a hackathon demo.

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui-style components
- React Router
- TanStack Query
- Lucide icons

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run the backend API in a second terminal:

```bash
npm run server
```

Open the app:

```txt
http://localhost:8080/welcome
```

If Vite starts on another port, use the URL shown in the terminal.

## Useful Routes

```txt
/welcome          App entry screen
/                 Customer home
/discover         Discover offers and map
/passes           Wallet/passbook
/profile          Customer profile
/merchant         Merchant home
/merchant/goal    Merchant goal setup
/merchant/review  AI offer review
/merchant/profile Merchant profile
```

## Environment Variables

Copy the backend environment template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
PORT=3001
HOST=127.0.0.1
```

`OPENAI_API_KEY` is read only by the backend. Do not expose it with a `VITE_` prefix.
If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing, the backend uses a deterministic fallback generator so the full demo flow still works.

For optional frontend event enrichment, create a local `.env.local` file:

```bash
VITE_TICKETMASTER_API_KEY=your_ticketmaster_api_key
```

The app still runs without this key by using demo/fallback data.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Hackathon Story

CityPulse Wallet answers the challenge by showing a working end-to-end MVP:

1. The wallet senses real-time city context.
2. The customer receives one relevant wallet-ready recommendation.
3. The merchant does not manually create coupons.
4. The merchant sets a goal and guardrails.
5. The AI generates a localized offer and explains why it is safe to activate.

The result is a city wallet experience that feels contextual, useful, and simple for both sides of the local economy.
